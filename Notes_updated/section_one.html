<h1> <b>BRIEF NOTES</b></h1>

# Internet 

A long connecting giant wire ultimately forming a web.

Server - 24x7 to serve, provide data and fulfilling the requests
of a user. 
A web server is a giant library and request anything.


When we type in any url, our browser sends a message to our ISP like AirTel, BSNL etc. that I want to 
access some website. They send this to Domain Name Server which acts as a phonebook, which will look up in the database 
as to what is the IP address of what you want to access. 

Once the IP is found, it is sent to our browser, and now we use this IP to send a direct request, which is sent through
an OFC underwater or satellite communication or whatever medium that forms the backbone of our system to navigation. 
IP Address does all that stuff. 

In a miliseconds the data from the server of the website is sent to us eg 216.58.210.46 is the IP address of Google homepage.


#Website working ?

In order to access a webpage we need a web-browser that allow us to look up the IP and be able to receive data which we can 
render on our system.

## HTML :

The HTML code file is responsible for the structure of the website, basically the structure and basic functionality.
as a builder to make walls and rooms and bla bla..

## CSS :

CSS is for styling the website. It involves everything including colors, stylish buttons, formatting and everything aroud it.
as a painter in house.

## JS :

It allows the website to have behaviour as in electricity in the house. 
Java Script enables functionality for us.


## Web Development Setup Requirements

1. Browser - Chrome would be best.

# HTML- Introduction


Using CodePen.io 

We can use this website to see live implementation of whatever our website is. We need to have some text or something to write on website as html.



Using documentation to study -
[MDN Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

(W3Schools)

(devdocs.io)


<b>Very important for building foundations study several several tags bro !</b>


## The Anatomy of HTML tags


    <hr size = "3"> 

    Here anything like size, color, align etc. is referring to the attributes which tell us about how the HTML tag element should appear.

    Start tag <h1> - this is a heading tag we have 6 heirarchial possible heading levels. h1 to h6.
 
    End tag </h1>

    Self closing tags <br>

    Tag omission - We look for this property of tags to know if it is a self-closing tag or not.

    Horizontal lines - <hr> tag


Bla bla look at the documentation whenever needed. It is way easier than ML Hhuhuh !



## Boiler Plate Codes for HTML or any other lang

Boiler codes are the basic structure codes, just a template to start with initialy which is generally written almost always. 
Mojibake - When the encoding or character set being used for a webpage does not match the right one which it should be rendered in, the website appear in completely different characters. 

utf-8 is a standard encoding is the best one to use, it encapsulates unicode, arabic, armenian, hindi, english, emojis and everything which renders everything very nice.

## Content of website

Body tag is used to contain most of the content. 

"em" Emphasis tag is more useful than italics tag because it emphasises the text with respect to other. "i" tag would just italicise.

<br>

Similar is the difference between "bold" and "strong" tag.

Paragraphs are implemented by "p" tag followed by a closing p tag. It helps to align lots of text in one orientation.

The "ul" tag encloses our list into points by using "li" tag for each item of the list, both tags followed by a closing tag.
Similarly we have "ol" tags. Make sure to check out their other attributes.


#### Image insertion

Just copy the image url from the internet and use img tag with src = "url", alt = "" alt is alternative text if an image can not be displayed.

#### Anchor tag 
The anchor tag has a little different structure and can be used to fill links.

"<" a href = "link" > Text to hyperlink "<" /a>


#### Table tag
Table with headings,captions, colors etc..
The table does not have column element. We create rows and to it we add several cells which are augmented in horizontal fashion.
