1. **Component Name**: MealItemForm

2. **Component Purpose**: Provides the add more dishes button in the menu.

3. **Props being passed to it:** item id and a function called addToCardHandler from MealItem file which uses context to refer it here.
   This also uses useState to render warning if absurd quantity added.

4. **States created in it:** `const [amountIsValid, setAmountIsValid] = useState(true);`
  `const amountInputRef = useRef();`

5. **Functions and their usage**:


6. **Child Components**:
   
   
7. **Crucial Concepts in the file**: 
	1. **UseRef Hook** 
	   ###### Does Not Cause Re-renders

		If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the `useState` Hook, we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render.
		To avoid this, we can use the `useRef` Hook.
		This hook is used here to access the input element in DOM and then based on that it checks of the value of ordered quantity is between 1 and 5 or not.
		The hook is  attached to the ref of Input element.
	2. **Forward Refs**
	   Need to understand this.
		In React, `forwardRef` is a utility function that allows you to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component. This is particularly useful when you want to access or manipulate the child component's DOM node directly from the parent component.
		
		In this example, the `ParentComponent` renders the `ChildComponent` and passes a `ref` to it using the `ref` prop. The `ChildComponent` uses `forwardRef` to make sure that the `ref` is forwarded to the `input` element. Additionally, the parent component uses the `inputRef` to focus the input directly and also provides a button to demonstrate focusing the input from the parent.
		```
		
		// ChildComponent.js
		import React from 'react';
		
		const ChildComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <input type="text" ref={ref} />
		      <button onClick={() => ref.current.focus()}>Focus Input</button>
		    </div>
		  );
		});
		
		export default ChildComponent;
		
		```

```
// ParentComponent.js
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Focus Input from Parent</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;

```
